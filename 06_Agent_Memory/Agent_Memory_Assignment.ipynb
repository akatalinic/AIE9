    "In this notebook, we'll explore **agent memory systems** - the ability for AI agents to remember information across interactions. We'll implement all five memory types from the **CoALA (Cognitive Architectures for Language Agents)** framework while building on our Personal Wellness Assistant use case.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Learning Objectives:**\n",
    "- Understand the 5 memory types from the CoALA framework\n",
    "- Implement short-term memory with checkpointers and thread_id\n",
    "- Build long-term memory with InMemoryStore and namespaces\n",
    "- Use semantic memory for meaning-based retrieval\n",
    "- Apply episodic memory for few-shot learning from past experiences\n",
    "- Create procedural memory for self-improving agents\n",
    "- Combine all memory types into a unified wellness agent\n",

    "\n",
    "What are the trade-offs between **short-term memory** (checkpointer) vs **long-term memory** (store)? When should wellness data move from short-term to long-term?\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider:\n",
    "- What information should persist across sessions?\n",
    "- What are the privacy implications of each?\n",
    "- How would you decide what to promote from short-term to long-term?\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Answer:\n",
    "Tradeoffs in short term memory vs long term memory when we talk about agent memories is are we willing to sacrifice persistence and risk to context scope. In short term memory we store context in only one thread, another chat with a different thread id won’t have info about previous interactions. In long term memory, information about a user with a specific user id is persisted, which can lead to more privacy risks etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Short term memory is easier to manage and has lower privacy risk due to the fact that the data is only persisted within a thread. In this case, personalization isn’t possible in multiple threads and the agent acts more like a stateless chatbot.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, long term memory, if implemented right, persists information across multiple sessions. In contrast to short term memory, it gives us a more personalized agent. The biggest tradeoffs are it needs bigger storage, we can potentially have worse performance, and the privacy risk is higher than in short term memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Information that should be persisted are our name, conditions, fitness goals etc. Everything that is user approved. Also, due to the fact that it stores personal information, we have to make sure 100% that the data can’t leak into other sessions from other users. For example, if there are two users named “Anna” we should secure that “Anna 1” can’t get long term memory of “Anna 2”, etc.\n",

    "Why use message trimming with a 128K context window when HealthWellnessGuide.txt is only ~16KB? What should **always** be preserved when trimming a wellness consultation?\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider:\n",
    "- The \"lost in the middle\" phenomenon\n",
    "- Cost and latency implications\n",
    "- What user information is critical for safety (allergies, conditions, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Answer:\n",
    "Due to the fact that we constantly preserve data in a conversation, we should trim the messages to prevent context from growing too large. Large context != better memory, it can introduce unnecessary noise, which then results in worse performance and reasoning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even if we have a large context window (128K), appending new messages can still degrade the quality of our model because it has to process more data that can be irrelevant or outdated.\n",
    "\n",
    "The “lost in the middle” phenomenon is also the reason why we should trim messages, because important information can be placed somewhere in the middle of the context, and our model can ignore it or weigh it less important.\n",
    "\n",
    "Larger contexts also increase the cost of running our model and have higher latency to responses. If we are using OpenAI models or Claude, larger prompts will eat more tokens, which will drive cost higher and response time will be higher.\n",
    "\n",
    "While trimming messages from our wellness agent, we should preserve safety and identity important information such as user information (age, name, preferences, injuries, allergies, etc.). Losing some of the data can lead to harmful or irrelevant advice, for example, if we have a bad knee, it could give us exercises that would make our knee even worse.\n",

      "\n",
      "1. **Start with Walking**: Since you enjoy walking, aim for at least 30 minutes a day, 5 days a week. You can gradually increase your pace or distance as you feel more comfortable. Walking is a low-impact exercise that’s gentle on your spine.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Incorporate Yoga**: Yoga can be a fantastic addition to your routine. It not only helps with flexibility and strength but also promotes relaxation and mindfulness, which can be beneficial for weight loss. Look for beginner classes or online videos that focus on gentle yoga, especially those that are spine-friendly.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Set Realistic Goals**: Aim for a gradual weight loss of about 1-2 pounds per week. This is a healthy and sustainable rate. Celebrate small victories along the way to keep yourself motivated!\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Nutrition**: Focus on a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins. Since you have a peanut allergy, be sure to find alternative sources of protein, like beans, lentils, or seeds. Consider consulting a nutritionist for personalized meal planning.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Stay Hydrated**: Drink plenty of water throughout the day, especially before and after your workouts. Staying hydrated can help with weight loss and overall health.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Listen to Your Body**: With your spine injury, it's crucial to pay attention to how your body feels during and after exercise. If something doesn’t feel right, don’t hesitate to modify your activities or consult a healthcare professional.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Consistency is Key**: Try to stick to your morning workout routine as it aligns with your preferences. Consistency will help you build a habit and see results over time.\n",

      "Hi Ana! It's great to see that you're focused on building muscle. Given your age, fitness level, and preferences, here are some personalized strategies to help you achieve your goal:\n",
      "\n",
      "### 1. **Strength Training Routine:**\n",
      "   - **Focus on Compound Movements:** Incorporate exercises like squats, deadlifts, bench presses, and rows. These exercises engage multiple muscle groups and are effective for building muscle.\n",
      "   - **Progressive Overload:** Gradually increase the weights you lift over time. Aim for 3-4 sets of 6-12 reps for each exercise.\n",
      "   - **Split Routine:** Consider a split routine where you focus on different muscle groups on different days (e.g., upper body one day, lower body the next).\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2. **Cycling for Cardio:**\n",
      "   - Use cycling as a form of cardio to complement your weight training. It can help improve your cardiovascular fitness without compromising muscle gains.\n",
      "   - Aim for 20-30 minutes of cycling after your weight training sessions or on alternate days.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 3. **Nutrition:**\n",
      "   - **Protein Intake:** Ensure you're consuming enough protein to support muscle growth. Aim for about 1.6 to 2.2 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight. Include sources like chicken, turkey, lean beef, eggs, dairy, legumes, and plant-based proteins.\n",
      "   - **Balanced Diet:** Incorporate a variety of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and healthy fats. Since you have a shellfish allergy, focus on other protein sources and be mindful of cross-contamination.\n",
      "   - **Hydration:** Stay well-hydrated, especially during your workouts.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 4. **Recovery:**\n",
      "   - Allow adequate recovery time between workouts. Muscle growth occurs during rest, so ensure you're getting enough sleep and rest days.\n",
      "   - Consider incorporating stretching or yoga to improve flexibility and prevent injuries.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 5. **Track Your Progress:**\n",
      "   - Keep a workout journal to track your lifts, sets, and reps. This will help you see your progress and stay motivated.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 6. **Stay Consistent:**\n",
      "   - Consistency is key! Stick to your routine and make adjustments as needed based on how your body responds.\n",

      "3. **Deep Breathing Exercises**: Simple deep breathing techniques can help calm your mind and body. Try inhaling deeply through your nose, holding for a few seconds, and exhaling slowly through your mouth.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Connect with Others**: Talking to friends or family can provide support and help you feel less isolated. Sometimes just sharing your feelings can lighten the load.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Time Management**: Organizing your tasks and setting priorities can help you feel more in control and reduce feelings of overwhelm.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Healthy Eating**: A balanced diet can impact your mood and energy levels. Try to include plenty of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins in your meals.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Sleep Hygiene**: Ensure you’re getting enough quality sleep. Establish a calming bedtime routine and try to go to bed and wake up at the same time each day.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **Limit Caffeine and Alcohol**: Both can increase feelings of anxiety and disrupt your sleep patterns, so it might be helpful to monitor your intake.\n",

      "3. **Pelvic Tilts**: Lie on your back with your knees bent and feet flat on the floor. Gently flatten your lower back against the floor by tilting your pelvis upward. Hold for a few seconds, then relax. Repeat 10-15 times. This strengthens your core and supports your back.\n",

    "\n",
    "How would you decide what constitutes a **\"successful\" wellness interaction** worth storing as an episode? What metadata should you store alongside the episode?\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider:\n",
    "- Explicit feedback (thumbs up) vs implicit signals\n",
    "- User engagement (did they ask follow-up questions?)\n",
    "- Objective outcomes vs subjective satisfaction\n",
    "- Privacy implications of storing interaction data\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Answer:\n",
    "We can decide that the interaction was good enough for storing it as an episode when the user received useful advice.\n",
    "\n",
    "We should filter what is useful and what is not useful by direct user indicators such as giving explicit feedback, like a thumbs up or down for our information, or directly saying that the information is helpful or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Implicit signals can also be useful, for example when the user asks follow-up questions. This can show that the information was somewhat useful but not fully satisfactory. Useful metadata we can store are timestamps, the topic of conversation for our wellness agent, and the confidence level of the given information, etc.\n",
    "\n",

    "## ❓ Question #4:\n",
    "\n",
    "For a **production wellness assistant**, which memory types need persistent storage (PostgreSQL) vs in-memory? How would you handle memory across multiple agent instances (e.g., Exercise Agent, Nutrition Agent, Sleep Agent)?\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider:\n",
    "- Which memories are user-specific vs shared?\n",
    "- Consistency requirements across agents\n",
    "- Memory expiration and cleanup policies\n",
    "- Namespace strategy for multi-agent systems\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Answer:\n",
    "For a production wellness assistant I would say that semantic, episodic and procedural memory should be persisted in PostgreSQL, while short-term memory should stay in in-memory storage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Short-term memory is only needed for the conversation that is running, and we can “erase it” after restart. Long-term memory, on the other hand, is useful for conversation and a personalized approach.\n",
    "Semantic, episodic and procedural memory can be used for helping different users with similar or the same problems because the feedback received from other users helps us filter what is okay and what is not okay.\n",
    "\n",
    "User-specific memories should be separated from shared memories. Goals, allergies, injuries, name, etc. are user-specific, while shared memories like general wellness knowledge, workout and nutrition templates can be reused.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple agents should all read and write to the same database so we have a single source of truth, which is important because one agent can miss important information that was stored by other agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "Memory expiration and cleanups should happen due to the fact that our database would grow endlessly, which in the end will affect our performance. Also, information is always changing, so if we do not clean data we can give outdated info. With GDPR, privacy is important, so cleaning personal data after some time is needed, or if a user asks to delete their personal info.\n",
    "\n",
    "Namespace strategy is also important, for example (user_id, \"profile\"), (user_id, \"episodes\"), and (shared, \"knowledge\"). This prevents mixing user data and allows scaling to multiple users and multiple agents without data leakage."

    "In this session, we explored the **5 memory types** from the CoALA framework:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Memory Type | LangGraph Component | Scope | Wellness Use Case |\n",
    "|-------------|---------------------|-------|-------------------|\n",
    "| **Short-term** | `MemorySaver` + `thread_id` | Within thread | Current consultation |\n",
    "| **Long-term** | `InMemoryStore` + namespaces | Across threads | User profile, goals |\n",
    "| **Semantic** | Store + embeddings + `search()` | Across threads | Knowledge retrieval |\n",
    "| **Episodic** | Store + few-shot examples | Across threads | Past successful interactions |\n",
    "| **Procedural** | Store + self-reflection | Across threads | Self-improving instructions |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Takeaways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Memory transforms chatbots into assistants** - Persistence enables personalization\n",
    "2. **Different memory types serve different purposes** - Choose based on your use case\n",
    "3. **Context management is critical** - Trim and summarize to stay within limits\n",
    "4. **Episodic memory enables learning** - Show, don't just tell\n",
    "5. **Procedural memory enables adaptation** - Agents can improve themselves\n",
    "\n",
    "### Production Considerations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use `PostgresSaver` instead of `MemorySaver` for persistent checkpoints\n",
    "- Use `PostgresStore` instead of `InMemoryStore` for persistent long-term memory\n",
    "- Consider TTL (Time-to-Live) policies for automatic memory cleanup\n",
    "- Implement proper access controls for user data\n",
